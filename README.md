# Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi 5

This repository contains scripts and configurations for setting up and customizing Kali Linux on a Raspberry Pi 5.

## Overview

This project aims to provide a streamlined approach to getting a functional Kali Linux environment running on the Raspberry Pi 5. It may include scripts for:

* Initial setup and image flashing.
* Optimizations for the Raspberry Pi 5 hardware.
* Installation of specific tools or configurations.

**Please note:** Running Kali Linux involves using penetration testing and security auditing tools. Ensure you have the legal authorization to use these tools on your target systems.

## Prerequisites

* A Raspberry Pi 5.
* A microSD card (at least 16GB recommended).
* A USB drive or another computer to flash the Kali Linux image.
* An internet connection.
* (Optional) Peripherals like a keyboard, mouse, and monitor for initial setup.

## Installation

1.  **Download the Kali Linux Raspberry Pi image:** Obtain the appropriate image for your Raspberry Pi from the official Kali Linux downloads page. Look for the ARM64 image.

2.  **Flash the image to your microSD card:** Use a tool like Raspberry Pi Imager, balenaEtcher, or `dd` to flash the downloaded `.img.xz` file to your microSD card.

    ```bash
    # Example using dd (replace /dev/sdX with your microSD card device)
    sudo dd bs=4M if=kali-linux-*.img.xz of=/dev/sdX conv=fsync status=progress
    ```

3.  **Boot your Raspberry Pi 5:** Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi 5 and power it on.

4.  **(Optional) Initial Configuration:** Follow the on-screen prompts to set up your user, password, network, etc.

## Customization (Optional)

This section would typically describe any custom scripts or configurations included in your repository. For example:

* **`optimize_pi.sh`:** A script to optimize system performance on the Raspberry Pi 5. To run it:
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x optimize_pi.sh
    ./optimize_pi.sh
    ```
* **`install_tools.sh`:** A script to install specific security tools. To run it:
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x install_tools.sh
    ./install_tools.sh
    ```
* **Configuration files:** Instructions on how to modify specific configuration files for your setup.
